Notes on Avis Vehicle Replacement System

Supervisors / Team Leads mostly do cleanup work, and follow ups.
Calls come in via a proprietary PABX / email system, and are put into queues (which are managed by Supervisors)
Calls are captured onto the system by 3rd parties, and edited by agents.  Sometimes the calls are raw emails and pdfs which need to be captured.
PDF files should be able to be processed automatically.
Incoming data often needs to be cleaned by the agent.  This should be cleaned / validated automatically.
When the agent captures the call, it is posted to Wizard, but is not updated again after this, nor is the Wizard data pushed back to AVRS.
The agent needs to contact the branches for the 1st available car (for collect or deliver) - this info is not pushed to the application.
SMS data is not automatically recorded in the system
SMS's often need to be sent out, but this is mostly manual.
Text to read to customer is printed out, not displayed on the system, with approvals, etc.
Audit logging needs to be stepped up.
Attachments are mainly emails, but anything that needs to be saved with the order, this is currently captured in comments.
Comments need to be viewable by externals.
Comments should not be used as workflow.
Comments are often system duplicated - should not do this.
Status on orders is weird
The home page with orders is not logical, needs to be cleaned up
Single search bar
